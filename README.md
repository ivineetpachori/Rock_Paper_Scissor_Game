<pre>Overview
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in C++ is a simple console-based program that allows a user to play the classic game against the computer. The game randomly selects a choice for the computer, prompts the user for their choice, and then determines the winner based on the traditional rules of the game.

Components of the Program
Include Directives and Namespace Declaration
  
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
using namespace std;
  
#include <iostream>: Provides input and output stream functionality.
#include <cstdlib>: Includes functions for random number generation.
#include <ctime>: Provides time functions, which we use to seed the random number generator.
using namespace std;: Avoids the need to prefix standard library names with std::.
  
Function Definitions :-

getComputerChoice() 

string getComputerChoice() {
    string choices[] = {"Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"};
    return choices[rand() % 3];
}
  
This function randomly selects and returns one of the choices ("Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors") for the computer.
rand() % 3 generates a random index (0, 1, or 2) to select from the choices array.
  
getPlayerChoice() 
string getPlayerChoice() {
    string choice;
    cout << "Enter Rock, Paper, or Scissors: ";
    cin >> choice;
    return choice;
}
This function prompts the user to enter their choice and returns it.
      
determineWinner()
void determineWinner(string playerChoice, string computerChoice) {
    if (playerChoice == computerChoice) {
        cout << "It's a tie!" << endl;
    } else if ((playerChoice == "Rock" && computerChoice == "Scissors") ||
               (playerChoice == "Paper" && computerChoice == "Rock") ||
               (playerChoice == "Scissors" && computerChoice == "Paper")) {
        cout << "You win!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "You lose!" << endl;
    }
}
This function compares the player's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner.
If both choices are the same, it declares a tie.
Otherwise, it checks all winning combinations for the player and declares the winner or loser accordingly.
          
Main Function

int main() {
    srand(time(0));

    string playerChoice = getPlayerChoice();
    string computerChoice = getComputerChoice();

    cout << "Computer chose: " << computerChoice << endl;

    determineWinner(playerChoice, computerChoice);

    return 0;
}
srand(time(0));: Seeds the random number generator using the current time to ensure different results each time the program runs.
Calls getPlayerChoice() to get the user's choice.
Calls getComputerChoice() to get the computer's choice.
Displays the computer's choice.
Calls determineWinner() to determine and display the result of the game.
      
Summary
This C++ program provides a basic implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as input/output operations, 
random number generation, and conditional statements, making it an excellent example for beginners to learn from. </pre>
